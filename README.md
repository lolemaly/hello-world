# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.

This is my GitHub README.md file, where I write something about myself in my journey to learn and become effecent in data analytics and programming.

I've now learned how to:
Create a repository. 
Start and manage a new branch. 
Change a file and commit those changes to GitHub. 
Open and merge a pull request.
